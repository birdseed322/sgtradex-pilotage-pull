Clarifications regarding Haulier GPS data
- From observation, Haulio is pushing data around every 40 seconds
- Is there a way to batch the GPS data as it is coming in? Currently 1 request is 1 truck
- Appear to have duplicte data being sent from pitstop. Different request ID but same data.
- Tracking of each vehicle is a little erratic, interval is not really fixed, what determines when the haulier pushes gps data
- Pull lat long data must have 6dp
